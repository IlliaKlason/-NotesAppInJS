# NotesAppInJS

- [x] 1. Users can add, edit and remove notes. 
- [x] 2. List of notes is displayed in a form of table (HTML representation may vary: table, divs etc). The columns are time of creation, note content, note category. Categories are predefined: “Task”, “Random Thought”, “Idea”.
- [x] 3. Notes in the table should also display a list of dates mentioned in this note as a separate column. For example, for a note “I’m gonna have a dentist appointment on the 3/5/2021, I moved it from 5/5/2021” the dates column is “3/5/2021, 5/5/2021”.
- [x] 4. Users can archive notes. Archived notes are not shown in the notes list. Users can view archived notes and unarchive them.
- [x] 5. There should also be a summary table which counts notes by categories: separately for active and archived. The table is updated whenever users perform some action on notes. The summary table is shown on the same page as the notes table.
- [x] 6. There is no need to implement data storage. Simply create a JS variable which stores the data and prepopulate it with 7 notes so that they are shown when the page is reloaded.
